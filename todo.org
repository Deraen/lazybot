* Todo list
** DONE clj-github -> tentacles
** TODO old irclj -> new irclj
** TODO allow for the disabling of plugins on a channel-by-channel basis
** TODO improve initial configuration

e.g. Disable all but the most useful plugins. Also need to test it and make sure it is
working fine.

** TODO move the translate plugin to a new service

Google Translate is no longer free. We need to either delete the plugin or find a
new service to use in place of it.
** TODO fix issues with the Github plugin

There is some strange bug that is causing the Github plugin to fail if the bot hasn't
been reloaded at least once after starting up on my and Alan's VPS (the primary lazybot
instance). I've been having some issues with ports that have kept me from reproducing
things locally, but Alan plans to try to reproduce it soon.
** TODO weed out crappy and useless plugins
** DONE use jodaro's clj-wordnik
** TODO allow for github credentials to be supplied

In which case gists would end up under that account.

** TODO document the *shit* out of everything

With marginalia.
